# UV Sensor Readings

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to read UV (Ultraviolet) sensor values using an Arduino Uno. UV sensors are commonly used to measure the intensity of ultraviolet radiation in a given environment. This project provides a basic setup to read UV sensor values and display them on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Uno**
2. **UV Sensor Module (Analog Output)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the UV sensor module to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the UV sensor module to Arduino 5V and GND pin to Arduino GND.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 in the `setup()` function.

3. **Read UV Sensor Values:**
   - Read the analog value from the UV sensor using the `analogRead()` function.
   - Store the UV sensor value in a variable for further processing.

4. **Output Results:**
   - Print the UV sensor value to the Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring.
   - UV sensor values typically range from 0 to 1023, representing the intensity of UV radiation detected.

5. **Adjustments:**
   - Adjust the delay time according to the desired frequency of UV sensor readings.
   - Calibrate the UV sensor module if necessary for accurate readings in different lighting conditions.

#### Applications

- **UV Radiation Monitoring:** Monitor UV radiation levels in outdoor environments for health and safety purposes.
- **UV Index Measurement:** Calculate the UV index based on UV sensor readings for weather forecasting applications.
- **UV Exposure Monitoring:** Track UV exposure levels in wearable devices for personal health tracking.

#### Notes

- UV sensor modules may vary in sensitivity and calibration requirements, so refer to the sensor datasheet for accurate interpretation of sensor values.
- Ensure proper placement and orientation of the UV sensor module to capture UV radiation effectively.
